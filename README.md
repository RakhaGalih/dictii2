# Dictii

Dictii is a personal project application designed to search for definitions of English words. For instance, when you search for the word "love," the app provides various grammatical forms such as noun, verb, and more. It utilizes the API from [dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev) to fetch real-time definitions and related information. In this project, I learned to work with JSON Annotation for converting between JSON data and Dart objects, and Freezed Annotation to create immutable data classes, which simplified state management.

Additionally, I explored Flutter extensions to enhance the app's functionality, allowing for easier access to specific styles and methods throughout the application. I also implemented routing using Go Route for smooth navigation between screens and adopted the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This approach involved defining data models with Annotation, creating user interfaces to display definitions, and implementing controller functions to handle search logic and user interactions. This structured design significantly improved the app's functionality, maintainability, and scalability.
